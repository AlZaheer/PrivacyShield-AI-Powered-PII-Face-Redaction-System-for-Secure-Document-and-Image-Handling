# Fix Plan for PDF to Images Conversion Issue

## Root Cause
The error "Failed to convert PDF to images" occurs because the `pdf2image` library requires Poppler as a system dependency, which is not installed on your Windows system.

## Immediate Solution
1. Install Poppler for Windows
2. Add Poppler to your system PATH

## Code Improvements Needed
1. Better error handling in `pdf_handler.py` to provide more specific error messages
2. Add dependency checking to inform users about missing system requirements
3. Consider fallback methods for PDF processing

## Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Install Poppler
- Download Poppler for Windows from: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
- Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\poppler`)
- Add `C:\poppler\Library\bin` to your system PATH

### Step 2: Improve Error Handling
Modify `pdf_handler.py` to provide more informative error messages and check for dependencies.

### Step 3: Add Dependency Validation
Add checks in the application to verify that required system dependencies are installed.

## Implementation Details

### In `pdf_handler.py`:
1. Improve the `pdf_to_images` function to provide better error messages
2. Add a function to check if Poppler is available
3. Add fallback methods for PDF processing if Poppler is not available

### In `app.py`:
1. Add a check for system dependencies before processing
2. Provide clear error messages to users about missing dependencies
