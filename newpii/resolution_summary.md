# PDF Conversion Error Resolution Summary

## Issue Resolved
The "Failed to convert PDF to images" error has been successfully resolved by installing Poppler and adding it to the system PATH.

## What Was Done

1. **Identified the Root Cause**: 
   - The error was caused by missing Poppler system dependency
   - Poppler is required by the `pdf2image` Python library for PDF to image conversion

2. **Implemented Code Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error handling in `pdf_handler.py` to provide more specific error messages
   - Added detailed error messages in `app.py` to guide users when issues occur
   - Provided specific troubleshooting guidance for common PDF processing errors

3. **Verified the Fix**:
   - Confirmed that Poppler commands (`pdfinfo`, `pdftoppm`) are accessible
   - Tested PDF to image conversion and confirmed it works correctly

## Verification Results
- ✅ Poppler commands are available in the system PATH
- ✅ PDF to image conversion is working correctly
- ✅ The application should now be able to process PDF files without the conversion error

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Process PDF Files**:
   - Upload a PDF file using the sidebar
   - Select your de-identification options (PII redaction, face blurring)
   - Click "De-identify File"
   - Download the processed file when complete

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter any issues in the future:

1. **Verify Poppler Installation**:
   ```bash
   pdfinfo -v
   ```
   Should display Poppler version information

2. **Check PATH Environment Variable**:
   Ensure `C:\poppler\Library\bin` (or your Poppler installation path) is in your system PATH

3. **Restart Your Development Environment**:
   After making PATH changes, restart VS Code and any terminal windows
